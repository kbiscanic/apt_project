TASK
7) Semantic textual similarity
Your task is to assess the semantic similarity between two texts. For longer texts this can
be solved very well using simple word overlap, but you will be working with short texts.
You must build a system based on machine learning (use a regression model). Training
and testing of your system should be done on datasets from the SemEval 2012 Task 6. You
need to evaluate the performance of your system using Pearson and Spearman correlation
with human similarity judgements.
